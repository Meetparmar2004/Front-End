Que : What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?

Ans : 
        == (Equality Operator) : -> Compares only values, not data types.
                                 -> If the types are different, JavaScript automatically converts them before comparison (type coercion).
                        
                        --> Example : 5 == "5   // true (because "5" is converted to number)

        === (Strict Equality Operator) : -> Compares both value and data type.
                                         -> Returns true only if both are exactly the same.

                        --> Example : 5 === "5" // false (number is not equal to string)
                                      5 === 5   // true
