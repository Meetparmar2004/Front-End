Que : What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?

Ans :   1) Function Declaration :   -> A function declaration defines a function using the function keyword followed by a name.
                                    -> It is hoisted, meaning it can be called before it is defined in the code.

                                        --> Syntax :    function greet() {
                                                            console.log("Hello");
                                                        }
                                                        greet();    // can be called before and after defination

        2) Function Expression :    -> A function expression assigns a function to a variable.
                                    -> It is not hoisted, so it can only be called after it is defined.

                                        --> Syntax :    const greet = function() {
                                                            console.log("Hello");
                                                        }
                                                        greet();    // Works only after defination
