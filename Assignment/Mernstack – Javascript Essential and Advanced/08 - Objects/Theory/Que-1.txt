Que : What is an object in JavaScript? 
      How are objects different from arrays?

Ans : --> Objects : -> An object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key (also called a property) is associated with a value.
                    -> Objects are used to store and organize related data in a structured way.

            --> Example :   let person = {
                                name : "Alice",
                                age : 25,
                                city: "Mumbai"
                            };

            1) Object : > Data Structure    - Collection of key-value pairs
                        > Access            - Accesses by key name
                        > Use Case          - Suitable for structured data or records
                        > Example           - let person = {name:"Alice", age:25}

            2) Array :  > Data Structure    - Ordered collection of elements
                        > Access            - Accesses by index (0,1,2...)
                        > Use Case          - Suitable for lists or sequences
                        > Example           - let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana"]
