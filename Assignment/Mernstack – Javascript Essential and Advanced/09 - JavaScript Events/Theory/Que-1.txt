Que : What are JavaScript events?
      Explain the role of event listeners.

Ans :   1) JavaScript Events :  -> JavaScript events are actions or occurrence that happen in a web page which the browser can detect.
                                -> These events can be triggered by the user's interaction (like clicking, typing, or moving the mouse) or by the browser itself (like page loading or resizing).

                --> Common Examples of Events : > onclick - when a user clicks an element
                                                > onmouseover - when the mouse moves over an element
                                                > onkeydown - when a key is pressed
                                                > onload - when a web page finishes loading

                            --> Example : <button onclick="alert('button clicked!')>click me </button>

        2) Event Listeners :    -> An event listener is a function that waits for a specific event to occur on an element and then executes a block of code in response.
                                -> It allows you to handle events separatly from HTML, which makes your code cleaner and easier to manage.
                
                --> Syntax :    element.addEventListener(event, function);

                --> Example :   let button = document.getElementById("myBtn");
                                button.addEventListener("click",function() {
                                    alert("button wad clicked!");
                                });
