Que : What is control flow in JavaScript? 
      Explain how if-else statements work with an example.

Ans :   --> Control Flow in JavaScript :    -> Control Flow in JavaScript refers to the order in which statements are executed in a program.
                                            -> By default, code runs from top to bottom, but with control flow statements (like if-else).
                                            -> We can change this order and make decisions in the program.

        --> if-else Statements :    -> The if-else statement is used to execute a block of code only if a condition is true, and another block if the condition is false.
                                    -> It allows decision-making in programs.

                --> Syntax : if (condition) {
                                // code runs if condition is true
                            } else {
                                // code runs if condition is false
                            }

                --> Example : let age = 18;
                              
                              if (age >= 18) {
                                console.log("You are eligible to vote.");
                              } else {
                                console.log("You are not eligible to vote.")
                              }

                    --> Output : You are eligible to vote.
