    --> Role of JavaScript in web development :

        --> Client-Side Interactivity : JavaScript is fundamental for creating dynamic and interactive user experiences directly within the user's web browser.

        --> Server-Side Development (Node.js) : With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript expanded its reach to server-side development.
                -> Build web servers and APIs.

                -> Interact  with database.

                -> Perform file system operations.

        --> Cross-Platform Development : JavaScript frameworks and libraries like React Native and Electron enable the creation of mobile applications and desktop applications using a single JavaScript codebase.

        --> Asynchronous Operations : JavaScriptfacilitates asynchronous operations, allowing web pages to fetch data from servers in the background without freezing the user interface.
