Que : What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?

Ans : 1) Condition Checking : -> In a while loop, the condition is checked before the loop body runs.
                              -> In a do-while loop, the condition is checked after the loop body runs.
    
      2) Execution Guarantee : -> A while loop may not run at all if the condition is false initially.
                               -> A do-while loop always runs at least once, even if the condition is false.

      3) Syntax Example : -> while loop :   let i = 5;
                                            while (i < 5) {
                                                console.log("Inside while loop");   // will not run
                                            }
                            
                          -> do-while loop :    let i = 5;
                                                do {
                                                    console.log("Inside do-while loop");   // runs once
                                                } while (i < 5);
