Que : Explain the different types of loops in JavaScript (for, while, do-while). 
      Provide a basic example of each.

Ans : --> Loops in JavaScript : > Loops are used in JavaScript to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.

      1) for Loop : -> Used when the number of iterations is known in advance.
            --> Syntax :      for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
                                    // code block                  
                              }
            
            --> Example :     for (let i = 1; i <=5; i++) {
                                    console.log(i);            
                              }

      2) while Loop : -> Used when the number of iterations is not fixed and depends on a condition.
            --> Syntax :      while (condition){
                                    // code block                  
                              }
            
            --> Example :     let i = 1;
                              while (i <=5) {
                                    console.log(i);
                                    i++;
                              }

      3) do-while Loop : -> Similar to while, but it executes the block at least once, even if the condition is false.
            --> Syntax :      do {
                                    // code block                  
                              } while (condition);
            
            --> Example :     let i = 1;
                              do {
                                    console.log(i);
                                    i++;
                              } while (i <=5);
