Que : What is the difference between undefined and null in JavaScript?

Ans :   --> Undefined : -> Undefined means a variable has been declared but no value has been assigned to it.
                        -> It is the default value given by JavaScript to uninitialized variables.

                -> Example :    let x;
                                console.log(x);  // undefined

        --> Null :  -> Null is an intentional assignment that represents "no value" or "empty value".
                    -> A developer sets a variable to null to indicate that it is blank or has no data.
            
                -> Example :    let y = null;
                                console.log(y);  // null

        --> Key Difference : -> undefined is automatically assigned by JavaScript.
                             -> null is manually assigned by the programmer to represents nothing.
