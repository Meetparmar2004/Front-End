Que - Why is this.setState() used in class components, and how does it work?

Ans - --> Why this.setState() is used :
                -> Directly changing state using this.state does not update the UI.
                -> this.setState() ensures that React properly tracks state changes.
                -> It triggers re-rendering of the component when data changes.
                -> It keeps the UI in sync with the component's data.

     --> How this.setState() works :
                -> When this.setState() is called, React does not immediately update the state.
                -> React places the update in a queue and processes it efficiently.
                -> The new state is merged with the existing state.
                -> React calls the render() method again.
                -> Only the updated parts of the UI are changed.
