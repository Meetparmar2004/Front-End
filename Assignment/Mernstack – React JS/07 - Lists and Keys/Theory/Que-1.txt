Que - How do you render a list of items in React?
      Why is it important to use keys when rendering lists?

Ans -   -> In React, a list of items is rendered by looping over an array and converting each item into a React element.
        -> This is usually done using JavaScript array methods like map().
        -> Each item in the list is displayed as a separate element in the user interface.

        --> Importance of using keys : 
                -> Keys are special attributes used by React to identify each list item uniquely.
                -> Using keys is important because :    > Keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed
                                                        > They improve performance during re-rendering
                                                        > They prevent unwanted UI updates
                                                        > They help React update only the required elements
