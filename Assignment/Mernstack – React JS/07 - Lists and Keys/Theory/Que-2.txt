Que -  What are keys in React, and what happens if you do not provide a unique key?

Ans -   -> In React, keys are special attributes used to uniquely identify elements in a list.
        -> Keys help React understand which items have changed, been added, or removed when a list is updated.
        -> Keys are usually assigned when rendering lists using methods like map().

        --> What happens if a unique key is not provided :  > React shows a warning in the console
                                                            > React may re-render unnecessary elements
                                                            > UI updates can become inefficient
                                                            > Incorrect data may appear in the UI
