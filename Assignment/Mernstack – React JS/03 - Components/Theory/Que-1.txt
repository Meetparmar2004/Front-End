Que -  What are components in React?
       Explain the difference between functional components and class components.

Ans - Componetns :  -> In React.js, components are basic building blocks of a user interface.
                    -> A component is a self-contained, reusable unit that defines how a particular part of the UI should appear and behave.
                    -> Each component can have its own logic, data, and UI, making applications modular and easy to maintain.
                    -> There are two types of components : 1). Functional component & 2). Class component.

    1) Functional Componetns :  -> Functional components are simple JavaScript functions that return JSX.
                                -> Key features : > Written using plain JavaScript functions
                                                  > Easier to read and write 
                                                  > Use React Hooks (like useState, useEffect) for state and lifecycle features
                                                  > Faster and more lightweight 
                                                  > Most commonly used in modern React applications

    2) Class Componetns :   -> Class components are ES6 classes that extend React.Componetn.
                            -> Key features : > More complex syntax
                                              > Use this.state and this.setState() for state management
                                              > USe lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount()
                                              > Require render() method to return JSX
                                              > Mostly used in older React projects
