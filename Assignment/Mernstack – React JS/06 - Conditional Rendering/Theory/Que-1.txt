Que - What is conditional rendering in React? 
      How can you conditionally render elements in a React component?

Ans -   -> Conditional rendering in React means displaying different UI elements based on a condition, such as user input, state value, or props.
        -> It allows a component to render specific content only when certain conditions are met.

        --> How conditional rendering is done : -> React uses normal JavaScript conditions to decide what should be shown on the screen.
                                                -> Some common ways to conditionally render elements are : 
                                                            > Using if-else statement : Components can return different JSX based on conditions.
                                                            > Using ternary operator ( ? : ) : This is used when rendering one of two elements based on a condition.
                                                            > Using logical AND (&&) operator : This is used when an element should be rendered only if the condition is true.
