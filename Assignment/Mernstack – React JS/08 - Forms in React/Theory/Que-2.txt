Que - What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?

Ans -   --> Controlled components : > In controlled components, form input values are managed using React state.
                                    > The value of the input is controlled by the components, and every change updates the state.

        --> Uncontrolled components : > In uncontrolled components, form input values are handled by the DOM itself.
                                      > React does not directly control the input value, and references are used to access the data.

        --> Key Differences : > Controlled components use state to manage form data
                              > Uncontrolled components rely on the DOM
                              > Controlled components provide better control and validation
                              > Uncontrolled components are simpler but less flexible
