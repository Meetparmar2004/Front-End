Que - How do you handle forms in React?
      Explain the concept of controlled components.

Ans -   --> Handling forms in React :   > Form inputs are connected to state variables
                                        > Events handlers like onChange are used to update the state
                                        > The form data is accessed through state instead of the DOM
                                        > onSubmit is used to handle form submission

        --> Controlled components : > A controlled components is a form element whose value is fully controlled by React state.
                                    > The value of the input comes from state
                                    > Any change in the input updates the state
                                    > React becomes the single source of truth for form data
