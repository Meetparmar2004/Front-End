Ans - Importance of Curly Braces {} in JSX:

            1). Display Dynamic Data :  -> Curly braces allow variables and values to be displayed dynamically in JSX.
                                        -> This helps in rendering changing data such as user names, counts, and messages.

            2). Execute JavaScript Expression :  -> Inside {}, developers can write JavaScript expression like: > Arithmethic operation, Function calls, Ternary expression.
                                                 -> This makes the UI responsive to logic and data changes.

            3). Use Props and State :   -> Curly braces are essential for accessing props and state values in JSX.
                                        -> Without {}, React cannot interpret JavaScript values inside JSX.

            4). Conditional Rendering : -> Curly braces allow conditional rendering using expression such as : > Ternary operator, Logical AND(&&).
                                        -> This helps show or hide UI element based on conditions.

            5). Inline Styling : -> Curly braces are used to apply inline styles in JSX using JavaScript objects, enabling dynamic styling of components.

            6). Event Handling : -> JavaScript Functions are passed to event handlers using curly braces, making interaction possible.
