Que - How are events handled in React compared to vanilla JavaScript? 
      Explain the concept of synthetic events.

Ans - --> Event Handling in React vs Vanilla JavaScript : 
                1) Syntax : 
                            -> Vanilla JavaScript : Events are attached using addEventListener() or HTML event attributes.
                            -> React : Events are written using camelCase syntax and passed as functions.
                2) Event Binding :
                            -> Vanilla JavaScript : Event listener are added manually to DOM elements.
                            -> React : Event handlers are passed directly as JSX attributes.
                3) Default Behavior :
                            -> Vanilla JavaScript : event.preventDefault() is used directly.
                            -> React : preventDefault() is also used, but through React's event object.
                4)  Performance :
                            -> Vanilla JavaScript : Event are attached to real DOM elements.
                            -> React : Uses a centralized event system, improving performance.

     --> Synthetic Events in React : -> A Synthetic Event is a wrapper around the browser's native event.
                                     -> React creates these events to ensure that the same way across all browsers.

            --> Features of Synthetic Events :  -> Provide cross-browser compatibility
                                                -> Follow the same interface as native events
                                                -> Improve performance by reusing event objects
                                                -> Work consistently across different browsers
