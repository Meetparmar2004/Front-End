What is CSS Flexbox, and how is it useful for layout design? Explain the terms flex-container and flex-item.

--> CSS Flexbox : CSS Flexbox (flexible Box layout) is a one-dimensional layout model in CSS used to arrange items in a row or a column.
                  It provides an efficient way to distribute space and align items within a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.
                  Flexbox is designed to simplify the process of creating responsive, flexible layouts without using floats or positioning.

--> Flexbox Uses : -> Allows easy alignment of items horizontally or vertically.
                   -> Supports responsive design by adjusting item sizes automatically.
                   -> Handles dynamic spacing and wrapping of elements.
                   -> Makes centering items very simple (both vertically and horizontally).

--> Flexbox Components : 

    1) Flex container : -> The parent element that holds flex items.
                        -> Made flexible by setting display: flex; or display: inline-flex;
                        -> Controls the layout direction, wrapping, and alignment of child elements.

            -> Example :    .flex-container {
                                display: flex;
                            }

    2) Flex Items : -> The child elements inside the flex container.
                    -> These items respond to the flex properties set by the container and can also have their own individual flex settings 
                        (e.g., flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis).

            -> Example :    <div class="flex-container">
                                <div class="flex-item">Item 1</div>
                                <div class="flex-item">Item 2</div>
                            </div>
