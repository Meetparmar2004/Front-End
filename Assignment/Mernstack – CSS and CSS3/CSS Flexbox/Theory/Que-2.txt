Describe the properties justify-content, align-items, and flex-direction used in Flexbox.

--> In CSS Flexbox, the layout of items inside a flex container is controlled using several properties.
    Among them, justify-content, align-items, flex-direction are key properties used to manage alignment and direction of flex items.


    1) flex-direction : -> Defines the main axis along which the flex items are placed.
                        -> Controls the direction of the layout (horizontal or vertical).

            -> Syntax : flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;

    2) justify-content : -> Align flex items along the main axis (which is defined by flex-direction).
                         -> Controls horizontal alignment when flex-direction: row;

            -> Syntax : justify-content: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around | space-evenly;

    3) align-items : -> Aligns flex items along the cross axis (perpendiculare to the main axis).
                     -> Controls vertical alignment when flex-direction: row;

            -> Syntax : align-items: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline;
