What is the difference between border-box and content-box box-sizing in CSS? Which is the default?

--> Box-sizing : In CSS, the box-sizing property is used to control how the total width and height of an element are calculated.
                 It determines whether the padding and border are included in the element's total size.


    1) content-box (Default) : 
            -> In content-box, the width and height properties apply only to the content of the element.
            -> Padding and border are added outside the content box, increasing the total size of the element.
            -> This is the default vlaue for the box-sizing property in CSS.


    2) border-box : 
            -> In border-box, the width and height include content, padding, and border.
            -> The total size of the element stays fixed as per the defined width and height.
            -> It makes layout calculation and design more predictable and easier to manage.
