Explain the concept of CSS specificity. How do conflicts between multiple stylesheet resolved?

--> CSS Specificity : It is a set of rules used by browsers to determine which style should be applied to an element when multiple styles conflict.
                      It defines the priority of CSS selectors.

--> Specificity Hierarchy : Each selector has a specific weight, and styles with higher weights override those with lower ones.
                            The specificity si calculated based on the type of selector.

    -> Selector Type                                                     |    Specificity Value
        1) Inline styles (e.g., style="...")                             |       1000
        2) ID selectors (e.g., #id)                                      |       100
        3) Class, attribute, and pseudo-class selector                   |       10
            (e.g., .class, [type="text"], :hover)                        |       
        4) Element and pseudo-element selector                           |       1
            (e.g., div, h1, ::before)                                    |
        5) Universal selector (*),  combinators, inherited styles        |       0

--> Conflicts Resolved : When multiple CSS rules apply to the same element:
                         1) Higher specificity wins.
                         2) If two rules have the same specificity, the last one written in the CSS takes effect.
                         3) A rule with !important will override any other rule (except another !important with higher specificity).
