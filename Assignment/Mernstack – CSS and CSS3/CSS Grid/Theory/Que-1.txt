Explain CSS Grid and how it differs from Flexbox. When would you use Grid over Flexbox?

--> CSS Grid : CSS Grid Layout is a morden, two-dimensional layout system in CSS.
               It allows web developers to design complex layouts by dividing a webpage intio rows and columns, creating a grid structure.
               Element (called grid items) can be placed precisely within this grid using defined lines or areas.
               To use Grid, set the container's display property to grid.
        
    -> Example :    .container {
                        display: grid;
                        grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
                        grid-template-rows: auto auto;
                    }

--> Features of CSS Grid : -> Works on both horizontal and vertical axes (2D layout).
                           -> Uses properties like grid-template-column, grid-template-rows, gap.
                           -> Grid items can span across multiple rows or columns.
                           -> Supports layout independent of document order.


--> When to Use CSS Grid over Flexbox :

        --> Use CSS Grid when : -> You need to design a complete layout structure (like a web page).
                                -> Both row and column control is required.
                                -> You want to precisely position items on a 2D grid.

        --> Use Flexbox when : -> You are working with elements in one direction (horizontal or vertical).
                               -> You need dynamic spacing or automatic alignment.
                               -> You are designing menus, buttons, navigation bars, or card layouts.
