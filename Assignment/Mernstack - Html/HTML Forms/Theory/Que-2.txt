Explain the difference between the GET and POST methods in form submission. When should each be used?

--> The main difference between GET and POST methods in form submission lies in how data is transmitted to the server.

--> GET : This method appends data to the URL as a query string, making it visible in the browser's address bar and potentially vulnerable.
    Use : -> Retrieving data
          -> Requests that are idempotent
          -> Requests that can be bookmarked or cached
          -> Requests with no side effects


--> POST : This method sends data in the request body, keeping it hidden and more secure.
    Use  : -> Sending data to create or update resources
           -> Requests that modify server state
           -> Requests with sensitive data
           -> Requests with large amounts of data
