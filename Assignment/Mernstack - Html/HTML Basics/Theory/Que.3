What is the difference between block-level elements and inline elements in HTML? Provide examples of each.

--> Block-level elements : block-level elements always start on a new line and take up the full width available.

    --> Example of Block-level elements : 
            1.  <div></div>
            2.  <p></p>
            3.  <h1> to <h6>
            4.  <form>
            5.  <ul>, <ol>, <li>
            6.  <header>, <nav>, <artical>, <section>, <footer>

--> Inline elements : inline elements do not start on a new line and only tak up as much width as their content requires.

            1.  <span>
            2.  <a>
            3.  <img>
            4.  <code>
            5.  <strong>, <em>, <b>
            6.  <input>, <button>, <label>, <select>
