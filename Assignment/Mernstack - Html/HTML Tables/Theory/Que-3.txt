Why should tables be used sparingly for layout purposes? What is a better alternative?

--> We should not use tables for page layout or to create a grid-based structure.
    Instead, use CSS for layout purpose.
    CSS is for presentation; using tables for layout can make code harder to maintain and more complicated.
